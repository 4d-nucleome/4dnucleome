    This 3-D model from single-cell Hi-C data represents how the mouse X chromosome is folded in a certain cell at a certain time. It will look different in different cells and/or at different times. (Takeshi Nagano and Tim Stevens/Wikimedia Commons)

    For the past decade scientists have catalogued which proteins are bound where and which chemical groups decorate the DNA at which positions to gain a deeper understanding of how the human genome is regulated. The resulting ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have taught us a lot about how our cells work and how things can go wrong in cells that lead to disease.

    Now the 4DN Nucleome project is set to take us to the next level of understanding genome function by cataloguing which parts of the genome are where within the nucleus in various cell types over time. This data will tell us even more about how genes are differentially regulated and what can go wrong with this process in diseased cells. This project will teach us so much…stay tuned!
